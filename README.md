# Raid teams Guide
Information and resources to help you succeed in Raid Teams Servers

## Quick Start
- You'll start with some gear that you don't want to lose
- Regarding Ammo:
    - The trader sells crazy amounts of ammo bundles and he restocks every in-game day
    - Ammo stacks are vanilla (9mm/44=300, 7.62=150), but bundle stacks are supercharged *and* you can re-bundle loose ammo in the field for 2 paper + glue or tape
    - We recommend storing a stack of each ammo**Bundle** type you use on your belt. That way, you can unpack these bundles when you need to by "using" them even without going into your inventory window
