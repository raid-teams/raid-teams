## Undead Legacy Setup (Mod Launcher)
This setup guide will use the Mod Launcher (by sphereii) and will do several steps for you automatically:
- copies existing game to a new directory so you can still play vanilla when you want
- disables EAC (required)
- keeps your save files for UL stored separately from vanilla
- keeps this separate copy of 7DTD content from automatically updating in steam, which could easily break your UL install

### Setting up with the Mod Launcher
*Our goal is to have Alpha 20 (b238) and UL 2.5.41 installed*

![Setup Version](https://github.com/raid-teams/raid-teams/raw/main/web-assets/version-image.png)

1. Download, install, and run the Mod Launcher: [download link](https://github.com/7D2DModLauncher/ThickInstaller/blob/master/SetupInstaller.msi?raw=true)
    - *If you're ok with the default install directory of `C:\7D2D\`, then be sure to click the folder button on the main page (before clicking anything) so you can change the drive/directory it installs things to*

3. Select Undead Legacy, stick with default options, and click `Install Game Copy`

5. As the launcher indicates, click`Pre-Sync Mod` and choose `yes` when asked if you want to download the mod (this can take some time, but you will see the progress near the bottom of the window in the `status` label)

6. Once complete, simply click `Play Mod` to launch it

### Copying your existing Player Profile (character model)
*If you want to copy your character profile, you can manually copy it to your Undead Legacy folder and avoid having to recreate your character.*
1. Copy your existing profile file named profiles.sdf, found in `%APPDATA%\7DaysToDie\Saves`
2. Paste this file into your Undead Legacy Saves directory and overwrite the existing file there.
    - by default, this will be under `C:\7D2D\Saves\Undead Legacy\Undead Legacy Stable`
