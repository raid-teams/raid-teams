# Raid teams Guide

Information and resources to help you succeed in Raid Teams Servers

## Quick Start

- You'll start...
  - with some gear that you don't want to lose
  - at level 300 with all skills maxed out
  - without any book knowledge; this is one of the only progression elements found in this server
- The world has...
  - nightly resets of all land not owned by `Teams`
  - no land claims: instead, you would need to join one of the 4 teams to get access to these are controlled by 
  - nightly bloodmoons
- `Teams`...
  - are like 'managed allies' (you'll notice the "allies" column in the players tab is disabled)
  - are protected from friendly fire (only for those on the same team, not the same party)
  - have access to land they can build on without it being reset (a 512x512 region; literally guild-sized land)
  - can be joined by accepting the Discord Invite (link below) and requesting to join a team
  - do not have to be joined, but you will be identified as a `Bandit` until you do
- `Bandits`...
  - are players without a team (any new player is automatically considered a bandit unless they are registered to a team before logging in)
  - are not protected from friendly fire (even if partying with a team player)
  - can become team members by joining discord and requesting to join a team
  - do not have any permanent home and cannot build on team land
  - can expect that anything they build will be wiped overnight (around 2am, Central)
- Ammo...
  - can be a problem starting out, but there are solutions
  - often drops in decent amounts from boss zombies
  - can be bought in VERY LARGE QUANTITIES from the Trader, who fully restocks his supply every single in-game day
  - can be re-bundled with simple crafting supplies that can also be purchased from the trader (click your loose ammo and click recipes for info)
    - *TIP: ammo stacks are sized to vanilla, but ammo bundles are double capacity: 20 for rifle bundles, 40 for pistol/magnum bundles. We recommend placing these on your toolbelt instead of loose ammo. You can also use ammo bundles from your tool-belt with a left-click without having to enter into your inventory - just make sure your bag isn't totally full when you do!*
